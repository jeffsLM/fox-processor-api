<h2>FPA - Fox Processor API</h2>
<p>FPA is a solution that centralizes, indexes and processes information about anime from different sources in order to provide episodes, images, summaries and all scalable information for viewing an anime without being tied to a single source.</p>

<h2>Architectural Pattern</h2>
<p>To create the FPA the link diagram below was used, it is possible to know how the project was structured as well as the use case that each route or helper would use:</p>
<p>Access in: <a href="https://whimsical.com/fox-anima-WEG53NZJCRLKqhCzW72Vvg@3CRerdhrAw8btSgM5wJ46k28">https://whimsical.com/fox-anima-WEG53NZJCRLKqhCzW72Vvg@3CRerdhrAw8btSgM5wJ46k28</a></p>

<h2>Define PORT aplication</h2>

by defalt, the port is 3333 but you can change it in the .env put PORT value

```
  //.env-file
  PORT=3333
```

<h2>Install and run FPA</h2>

```bash
 yarn install
 docker compose up
```

after running the command, you can run the migrations and popoulate the database with tables, with the command:

```bash
 yarn typeorm migrations:run
```

<h2>Project Pattern</h2>
FPA project is organized so that there are 5 encapsulators, namely:

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>/history</code> - The history of user
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>/fox</code> - Responsible for enabling queries of titles, episodes and more
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>/queue</code> - Queue controller, allows you to add one or more items
 in batch for processing
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>/populate</code> - Processes queue data with or without adding new titles
  </li>
</ul>
